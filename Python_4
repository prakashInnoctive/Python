Question 4:
Given a Matrix, convert it into the dictionary with keys as row numbers and values as a nested list.

Input : test_list = [[5, 6, 7], [8, 3, 2]]
Output : {1: [5, 6, 7], 2: [8, 3, 2]}

SOLUTION:
x=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
l=len(x)
d={}
for i in range(l):
      for j in x:
    			d[i+1]=j
print(d)
